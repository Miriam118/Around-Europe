<h1> Day 100 </h1>

I know I haven't been writing very often recently, but with all the deadlines, orchestra rehearsals and my new internship it's been hard to find the time. However, I had my last deadline of 2017 yesterday so I thought I would commemorate day 100 with some reflection on how it's going so far!

It's been an interesting 3 months and not always what I expected! But, on the whole I can say that I've learned a lot and although I'm excited to be going home on Sunday for some much needed Christmas down time, I'm looking forward to seeing what's going to happen over the next 6 months.

In terms of traveling, I've managed to visit Antwerp, Liège, Rotterdam, Namur and Bruges. I'm also getting up at 5am tomorrow to get the cheap bus to Cologne and I've got trips planned for Sofia and Berlin next year! Hopefully I'll be adding a couple more trips to this because being in Brussels means I'm so well connected to the rest of Europe!

Of course it's not all travels and fun but my workload so far has actually been ok. I have 5 exams to prepare for in January but they make it pretty easy for Erasmus students. For example, for my oral expression grade I receive 50% just by turning up to class -  so I've already passed that one!

What I was most curious about before leaving, was how long was it going to take before my French became fluent. But in order to become fluent you need to be speaking the language pretty regularly, something that isn't always easy in Brussels. Of course I knew that it would be a temptation to speak English with my fellow Erasmus students but that's not what I'm talking about here. Firstly, Brussels is right in the middle of the Flemish part of Belgium so a lot of things tend to be written in Dutch (I know zero Dutch). The main issue though, is that the population of Brussels is around 40% Belgian and 60% international. So either international people tend to speak English as it becomes the easiest shared language, or they will use their native language. Either way it means I'm not being exposed to as much French as I expected to be.

That being said, it just means I have to put in more effort. Something every language student understands - especially when you're trying to speak in your target language and the person you're talking to keeps on replying in English!

Looking back to me when I first moved here and me now, my French has improved so much. But it's a gradual thing, you don't notice it while it's happening. What I have noticed is that I've become so much more confident at speaking French, which I think is half the battle. I already had a lot of vocabulary and knowledge, I was just always too shy to realise it. Now that I've made that progress it's going to be so much easier to keep on improving until I reach the goal of complete fluency.

There's more I could say about the things I've learned since moving to Brussels, but it's late and I have that 5am start to get ready for! So, I'm going to leave you with what I think is still the most important (and annoying) thing to know about Brussels. The supermarkets continue to shut at 8pm, and it continues to be the single worst thing about living here! But I've said it before, and if after 3 months it's still the worst thing about being here then being here can't be all that bad.
