                I finally have a new phone and Iâ€™m back to blogging, so I can write about my amazing day trip to Bruges
                last week, 02/11/17!
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                As Iâ€™ve said before, the public transport in Belgium is very good. I was able to buy a JUMP 10 ticket
                for under 26â€™s for â‚¬52, which allows me 10 journeys (making it â‚¬5.20 per single). This is valid for 1 year,
                and has lots of flexibility. I can either make 10 singles on my own, or travel as a group of 10 and all of us
                can use the same ticket once. Also, with this ticket I can travel to anywhere in Belgium! The cost is the same
                regardless of where you go so long as itâ€™s in Belgium. Iâ€™ve already been to Antwerp and LiÃ¨ge and I canâ€™t wait
                to discover more places!
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                A few days before going we watched the film â€˜In Brugesâ€™ which I would recommend as its pretty funny! Plus
                itâ€™s always cool seeing somewhere in real life after seeing it in a movie, especially the bell tower.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                In terms of sightseeing we didnâ€™t plan much beforehand. We got off the train around lunch time, so after
                wandering for a while our first plan was to find somewhere to eat. This is where Iâ€™d really recommend checking
                Trip Advisorâ€™s â€˜Cheap Eatsâ€™. We found this great pasta place called â€˜Boccaâ€™ (Dweersstraat 13, Bruges 8000 Belgium),
                where we got a huge box of pasta for â‚¬6! This meant we had eaten well but still had money for hot chocolate later
                on in the day ðŸ˜‹Â 
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                We also went on a boat ride, which was only â‚¬8 for 30mins. This was a really fun and beautiful way to see around
                the town, and the commentary from our â€˜captainâ€™ was interesting too.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                We also saw inside one of the various churches, which was very beautiful, before looking around the shops.
                Bruges is incredibly touristy and the shopping is surprisingly good considering the size of the place - on
                par with Brussels I would say!
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                Bruges is definitely one of the most picturesque places Iâ€™ve been to, and I definitely plan on going back
                later this year to check out their Christmas markets!Â
