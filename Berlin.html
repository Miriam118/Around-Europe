                My boyfriend, Harry, and I booked this trip to Berlin around Nov/Dec time last year, but
                little did we know then that 'the beast from the east' was going to arrive and cause chaos!
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                My flight was due to leave from Brussels, and surprisingly enough, Brussels was not affected
                 by any of the stormy weather that I'd seen plastered all over the news. As you can see in this
                 pic above it was clear blue skies and sun, but don't let that fool you. The temperature was a consistent
                 '-5 but feel likes -8/-10'.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">

                Still, this was undoubtedly a lot better than what was going on in Glasgow, where Harry was due to
                fly from. As you probably already know, Glasgow airport was completely closed for a few days due to
                the snow. I tried to be hopeful, but by Thursday evening (the 2nd of March), I had pretty much accepted
                that I would be spending the weekend in Berlin alone because we were supposed to meet there the following
                 day. Fortunately, I was wrong! By some miracle, Harry managed to make it to Glasgow airport and although
                 his flight was delayed by an hour or so, he met me in the hostel later that evening!

            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                We decided to go back to the same hostel we stayed in when we last visited Berlin back in June 2017,
                which is called East Seven and I would highly recommend it. The price is good, the reception staff
                are friendly, the rooms are very comfortable and the kitchen is great. Plus, it's in a really good
                location which isn't a far walk from Alexanderplatz, and the nearest metro stop is only a few minutes
                 walk away.

            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">

                There are also a lot of great places to eat nearby. On the first night neither of us could be bothered
                to cook so we went to a pizza place that was literally 2 minutes walk away called 'Standard - Serious Pizza'.
                 Unfortunately, they weren't going to have a free table for another 45 mins so we got our food to takeaway and
                demolished it in the hostel kitchen. The next day we had some delicious beef bimipbab at a Korean restaurant,
                'Gong Gan' next door to the hostel which had been closed the last time we'd been there.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                The next day we took the U2 bahn 'Senefelderplatz' into 'Alexanderplatz' and went for a wander. We'd seen most
                 of the centre when we were in Berlin last summer but it was  fun to go round the places again, especially the
                 Museum Island. Although, I've got a lot more layers on in these photos than the ones from June...
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">

                In addition to Museum Island, we walked to the Brandenburg gate and through the Tiergarten park beyond it.
                Whilst in the park we could see the river was totally frozen. I tapped it with my foot but there was no way
                I was going to walk on it because I have no idea how to tell whether it's safe or not. As it turned out it
                was fine because further on through the park we saw lots of people ice skating, which is pretty cool!
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">

                As wonderful as all the sightseeing is, the real reason we chose to go to Berlin was to see the Berlin Philharmonic
                play Alpine Symphony, which is one of my favourite pieces. We also saw the same orchestra last June but this time it
                was great being able to dress up a little bit because last time I just had to wear one of the 4 outfits I'd brought
                travelling with me. The concert was at 7pm and was without a doubt one of the best concerts I've ever been to! At the
                interval we went down to buy something to eat. Doing this gave me a funny flashback to June when we'd gone to the
                concert without having dinner and then realised you could only pay cash at the bar. Back then we managed to scrape
                together enough change between us to get one pretzel to share! I remembered it being delicious and filled with butter
                but I was worried that maybe it only tasted so good last time because we'd both been so hungry. Thankfully it was
                just as delicious as I had remembered it. All in all, it was an amazing evening and we had the best time!
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">

                The Berlin Philharmonic is also listed as #16 on the top things to do in Berlin on Trip Advisor, and has a
                comfortable 2331 reviews rating it as 'excellent'. But I always find it fun to read the 'terrible' reviews,
                and the Berlin Philharmonic has 16 of these on Trip Advisor. I didn't read all 16 because the first few were
                hilarious enough, with one being titled 'what a racket.' The Berlin Philharmonic is an orchestra, and therefore
                plays classical music, but it appeared that a few people over the years have gone there without doing any research
                and expected an 'industrial rave' instead... Not sure if the Berlin Phil deserve a negative review for this because
                I'm pretty sure the words industrial rave have never been used to advertise any of their concerts. I feel sorry for
                 whoever went there expecting something like that because they must have had quite a shock.

                Sunday was our last day in Berlin, but Harry's flight was in the morning so I had the whole day to explore solo before
                catching my flight at around 6pm. I decided to go the East Side Gallery, a 1316 metre stretch of the wall with numerous
                murals painted directly on it.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">

                I walked the whole length of it and saw some very inspiring art pieces. There were too many to photograph and it was
                still bitterly cold so it was best to keep my hands in my pockets for warmth.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                This stretch of wall was along the riverside, and it was crazy to see that even the river Spree had been frozen in parts,
                I don't think I've ever seen so much ice in my entire life! And to be honest I'd happily not see any again, even the memory
                of this day is making me feel chilly.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">

                After exploring this area, I had a series of undergrounds and buses to the airport, before the final leg of my journey which was
                making it through Tegel airport and onto my flight. I misjudged how long it would take me to get to the airport and ended up being
                over 2 and a half hours early. Be warned, it is not necessary to be this early for a flight from Tegel, nor is there much to do
                there while you wait. Rather than having one main security check before duty free, the airport is a large circle of gates and each
                gate has its own mini security check. But you can't you through your gate until it is almost time for your flight and there are very
                few shops or places to buy food. This resulted in 2 very long hours of waiting doing nothing, but I was pretty knackered from all
                the walking I'd done so it wasn't too bad.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                All in all, I had a fantastic weekend in Berlin and it was great to spend some time with Harry - now to continue to catch up on my
                blog posts starting with my trip to Madrid last weekend!
